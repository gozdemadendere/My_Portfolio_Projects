### Project Objectives & Overview
#### 1. Overview
The Library of Montana State University has a website that students use to find books and articles.

Below the library picture, there is a search bar and three big items: “Find”, “Request” and “Interact”. All three of them contain access to important information and services about the library. However, the Website Analytics show that the “Interact” button has, ironically, almost no interactions.

The way to measure how each one of the three categories performs is by click-through rate (CTR), a common term in Online Marketing which typically describes the number of clicks an ad receives divided by the number of times the ad is shown.

#### 2. Purpose of the Project

The main purpose of this project is to perform an A/B Test to check CTR(click-through rate) for different text on a button on the website of Montana S. University.

After discussions with users and some brainstorming, the website team decided on 4 different new versions to test against the "Interaction" button:

- Connect
- Learn
- Help
- Services

The metrics to track were following:

- **Click-through rate (CTR) for the homepage:** Amount of clicks on the button divided by the total visits to the page. Selected as a measure of the initial ability of the category title to attract users.

- **Drop-off rate for the category pages:** Percentage of visitors who leave the site from a given page, selected as a measure of the ability of the category page to meet user expectations.

- **Homepage-return rate for the category pages:** Percentage of users who navigated from the library homepage to the category page, then returned back to the homepage. Homepage-return rate was therefore selected as a measure of the ability of the category page to meet user expectations.


#### 3. Technical Skills

- Python (Pandas)

#### 4. Conclusions

- "SERVICES" shows the best CTR of all options (although when compared to "CONNECT" not statistically significant) and has a ZERO PERCENT drop-off/homepage-return-rate.

- Students likes Services version more, rather than Connect.

- Homepage-return rate: The Services version is better at giving information to users they want.

- Therefore it's strongly advised to change the library's homepage and roll out the design with the "SERVICES"-button.
