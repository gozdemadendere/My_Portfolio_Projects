### Project Objectives & Overview
#### 1. Overview
The Montana State University Library has a website that students use to find books and articles.

Below the library picture, there is a search bar and three big items: ‚ÄúFind‚Äù, ‚ÄúRequest‚Äù and ‚ÄúInteract‚Äù. All three of them contain access to important information and services about the library. However, the Website Analytics show that the ‚ÄúInteract‚Äù button has, ironically, almost no interactions.

The way to measure how each one of the three categories performs is by click-through rate (CTR), a common term in Online Marketing which typically describes the number of clicks an ad receives divided by the number of times the ad is shown.

#### 2. Purpose of the Project 

The main purpose of this project is to perform an A/B Test to check CTR (click-through rate) for different text on a button on the website of Montana S. University.

The website team decided on 4 different new versions to test against the "Interaction" button:

- Connect
- Learn
- Help
- Services

The metrics to track were following:

- **Click-through rate (CTR) for the homepage:** Amount of clicks on the button divided by the total visits to the page. Selected as a measure of the initial ability of the category title to attract users.

- **Drop-off rate for the category pages:** Percentage of visitors who leave the site from a given page, selected as a measure of the ability of the category page to meet user expectations.

- **Homepage-return rate for the category pages:** Percentage of users who navigated from the library homepage to the category page, then returned back to the homepage. Homepage-return rate was therefore selected as a measure of the ability of the category page to meet user expectations.

#### 3. Steps of the Project

- Explore and prepare the data
- Define the hypothesis
- Divide the users into groups
- Collect data from both groups
- Analyze the results
- Test the hypothesis
- Draw conclusions

#### 3. Technical Skills

- Python (Pandas)

#### 4. Conclusions

It is strongly advised to change the library's homepage and roll out the design with the "**Services**" button according to the following reasons:

- **Services** shows the best click-through rate (CTR) of all options.

- **Services** version is better at giving information to users they want as it has a lower Homepage-return Rate.

- Students likes **Services** version more, rather than Connect.
