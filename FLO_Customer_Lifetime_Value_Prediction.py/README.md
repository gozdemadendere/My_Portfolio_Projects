### FLO | Customer Lifetime Value Prediction

Customer Lifetime Value is the monetary value a customer brings to a company over their relationship with that company.

CLTV Prediction is an analysis aimed at estimating the revenue a customer will generate for a company.

This method tries to predict future purchase probabilities by utilizing a customer's past behaviors and purchase habits.

It helps companies manage their relationships with customers and support marketing strategies.

CLTV Prediction = Expected number of purchases x Expected average profit
