## E-Commerce Company Eniac's Data-Driven Decision Making Journey

Eniac is an E-Commerce company that sells 100% technology products, mainly based on Apple-compatible (high-quality) accessories.
The company is considering a collaboration with Magist, a Software company offering a centralized order management system.
However, before diving into this partnership, Eniac seeks answers to critical questions regarding compatibility, market fit, and service quality.

#### 1. Project Objectives & Overview
The main objective of this project is to determine whether a partnership with Magist aligns with Eniac's strategic goals.

- It's not clear that the marketplaces Magist works with are a good place for high-quality tech products.

- Among Eniac’s efforts to have happy customers, fast deliveries are key. Are deliveries fast enough on Magist?

Thankfully, Magist has allowed Eniac to access a snapshot of their database. I'll answer the business questions by exploring the data using SQL Queries (Data Analysis) & Tableau (Data Visualization)

#### 3. Improvement of Data Collection

To enhance future analyses and decision-making processes, Eniac recommends increasing data collection efforts.
