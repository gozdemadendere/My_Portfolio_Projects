## Business Analysis  & Data Exploration | SQL & Tableau

#### Project Objectives & Overview
Eniac is an E-Commerce company that sells 100% technology products, mainly based on Apple-compatible (high-quality) accessories.

The main objective of this project is to answer this question: Should Eniac to sign a contract with Magist, a Software company that offers a centralized order management system?

- It's not clear that the marketplaces Magist works with are a good place for high-quality tech products.

- Among Eniac’s efforts to have happy customers, fast deliveries are key. Are deliveries fast enough on Magist?

Thankfully, Magist has allowed Eniac to access a snapshot of their database. I'll answer the business questions by exploring the data using SQL and visualizing with Tableau.

**Final Recommendation:** 

As a result of SQL queries and analysis, Magist Software Company may not be a good fit for Eniac.

I recommend that Eniac **should not** sign the contract with Magist for the following reasons:

- Mostly **non-tech products** are sold in Magist marketplaces. But Eniac sells 100% technology products.
There are 32.951 products in Magist Marketplaces and **90%** of them are non-tech products. 
- Mostly **cheap products** are sold in Magist marketplaces. The average price of tech products in Magist Marketplaces is **€297**, but Eniac's Avg. Product Price is **€540**.
- In Magist Marketplaces, **80%** of the **revenue** comes from non-tech products.
- The average **delivery time** is 12 days in Magist market, while Apple standard delivery time is 1-3 days.

There is a lack of data to make a better decision.


**However, according to the available data, Magist is not a good fit for high-quality tech products.**

#### 4. Improvement of Data Collection
- It would be great to see **brand information** for Magist Marketplaces as Eniac only sells Apple compatible (high quality) products.
- It would be better to have product **names and descriptions** as they will give us more information.
