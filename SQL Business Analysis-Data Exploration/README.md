## Business Analysis for Data-Driven Decision Making
 
Eniac is an E-Commerce company that sells 100% technology products, mainly based on Apple-compatible (high-quality) accessories.
The company is considering a collaboration with Magist, a Software company offering a centralized order management system.
However, before diving into this partnership, Eniac seeks answers to critical questions regarding compatibility, market fit, and service quality.
 
#### Project Objectives & Overview
The main objective of this project is to determine whether a partnership with Magist aligns with Eniac's strategic goals. 

- It's not clear that the marketplaces Magist works with are a good place for high-quality tech products.
 
- Fast deliveries are key to Eniac’s efforts to have happy customers. Are deliveries fast enough on Magist?

Thankfully, Magist has allowed Eniac to access a snapshot of their database. I'll answer the business questions by exploring the data using SQL Queries (Data Analysis) & Tableau (Data Visualization)

#### Improvement of Data Collection

To enhance future analyses and decision-making processes, Eniac recommends increasing data collection efforts. 

- It would be great to see **brand information** for Magist Marketplaces as Eniac only sells Apple-compatible (high quality) products.
- It would be better to have product **names and descriptions** as they will give us more information.
