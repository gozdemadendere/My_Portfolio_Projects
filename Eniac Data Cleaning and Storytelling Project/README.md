## Eniac Data Cleaning & Storytelling | Python 

### Project Objectives & Overview
#### 1. Business Problem

Eniac is an E-Commerce company that sells 100% technology products, mainly based on Apple-compatible (high-quality) accessories.

Specifically, they ask us to analyze and advise **whether it is beneficial to discount products.**

#### 2. Purpose of the Project
The main goal of this project is to implement the data cleaning and data quality process, which includes:

- Evaluating and cleaning data to make it usable

- Evaluating the impact of discounts on sales/revenue

- Make a recommendation for more discounts

In addition, we should answer some business questions about the use of discounts for the Eniac company.

#### 3. Technical Skills

- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

#### 4. Conclusions

**Final Recommendation:** Discounts should continue, but with a fixed upper limit of 30% as more revenue is provided with discounts of up to 30%. 

- Discounts in the Storage & Memory category are more beneficial & in the Accessories category are not really beneficial.

- Discounts should especially concentrate on special holidays like Black Friday and Cyber Monday.


#### 5. Improvement of Data Collection

- Price: Formatting of price should be standardized (with two decimals).

- Remove/ Reject Duplicates: Data quality must be ensured as there are many missing values and duplicates.

- Datetime-Format: Automatically import date-inputs as datetime-format

- All data regarding orders should collected in one data frame.

- Column Names: Columns to have the same name if they contain the same information

- Discounts: Share specific details about the discounts like: general, individualised etc.
