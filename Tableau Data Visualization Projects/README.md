This retail dashboard is a tool that collects data from across the company and compiles the information into easy-to-understand visual formats.

Users can drill down for a more detailed view of operations to see data on specific key performance indicators (KPIs) and relevant metrics, such as sales and profit on category, segment, or city based.
