## Kevin Cookie Company Interactive Dashboard | MS Excel

### Project Objectives & Overview

#### 1. Business Problem

Kevin Cookie Company would like to have a dashboard that displays an overview of the performance and sales of the different types of cookies sold.

#### 2. Purpose of the Project

I've created and desighned a dashboard using Excel to highlight the most important information and key performance indicators (KPIs) for Kevin Cookie Company.
The dashboard is dynamic & interactive and adjusts depending on the country, months, and products selected via the slicer.

The data for this dashboard was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lawrencestratvert/kevin-cookie-company-financial-analysis).


#### 3. Technical Skills

I used the following MS Excel skills to manipulate the data and create the dashboard:
- Data Cleaning
- Data Manipulation
- Functions (VLOOKUP, IF, SUM, CONCATENATE, MID/LEFT, UPPER, TEXT)
- Pivot Tables
- Charting & Dashboard Creation
- Slicers / Action Filters
- Formatting


#### 4. Conclusions

Key Insights:
- June, October and December with more sales
- In terms of sales across the country, the UK, US and India recorded very high sales and profits.
- Categorically, "Chocolate Chip" cookies had amazing sales this year.

Recommendations :
- More products should be sold to the UK, US and India.
- Product stocks should be increased in June, October, and December because sales were higher.
- Also, the best performing product "Chocolate Chip" cookie, as shown, should be stocked more as it was purchased the most.
