### A/B Testing - Comparison of Button Performances on the Montana State University Library Website

A/B testing is a technique used to determine which version of a product, method, or service performs better by comparing two versions.

It is commonly used to improve website design, app design, advertising, pricing, and other aspects of user experience.

The primary objective of comparing two groups is to test whether any differences observed are due to chance.

### 1. BUSINESS PROBLEM / PROJECT OBJECTIVE

Montana State University Library has a website that students use to find books and articles.

Website Analytics indicate that the "Interact" button has, ironically, almost no interactions. Performance is measured using the click-through rate (CTR).

The main purpose of this project is to conduct an A/B Test to test the CTR of different texts on the "Interact" button on the Montana State University website.

The website team selected 4 different new versions/texts to test against the "Interact" button: Connect, Learn, Help, Services.

### 3. PROJECT RESULTS

Based on hypothesis tests, the Services and Connect buttons showed statistically significant performance differences compared to the other 3 buttons.

However, there is no statistically significant difference in conversion between the Services and Connect buttons.
(In other words, no significant performance difference was observed between these 2 buttons. The differences observed are due to chance.)

#### Recommendations:

- The click-through rate (CTR) for Services and Connect is better than the other buttons (and the click-through rate for the Services button is higher).
- However, the likelihood of getting clicks for these 2 versions is equal, and the observed differences are due to chance. We can focus only on these two versions going forward.
  
It is strongly recommended to change the library's homepage and present the design with the "Services" button for the following reasons:

- Services demonstrate the best click-through rate among all options.
- In the Services version, the Homepage-return rate is lower, indicating better information delivery to desired users.
- Students have expressed a preference for the Services version over Connect.
