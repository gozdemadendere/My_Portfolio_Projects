## MOVIE RECOMMENDER SYSTEM | Python

### Project Objectives & Overview
#### 1. Overview

Ursula, the owner of the DVD store WBSFLIX, wants to take her store online. She currently operates in a small town near Berlin and is still surviving thanks to a loyal customer base that appreciates the local atmosphere and, more than anything, the personal recommendations from Ursula.

Ursula is realizing that, as her customer base grows, it is difficult for her to find recommendations for each customer. With the move to an online store, recommending movies would be almost impossible. She thinks her store could have a design similar to another popular site for movies:

Ursula has shared her store database with me and working as a freelance Data Scientist my task is to create recommender systems that give users from WBSFLIX relevant content to watch.

#### 2. Purpose of the Project

The main objective of this project will be to create 3 different recommender systems that give users from WBSFLIX relevant content to watch:

- Popularity Based Recommender
- Item Based Recommender
- User Based Recommender
