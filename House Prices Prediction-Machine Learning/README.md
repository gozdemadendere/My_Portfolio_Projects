## House Prices Prediction | Supervised Machine Learning

### Project Objectives & Overview
#### 1. Business Problem

As a data scientist working for a real estate investment firm interesting, our task is to develop a model to predict the selling price of a given home in Ames, Iowa from 2006 to 2010.

Our employer hopes to use this information to help assess whether asking price of a house is higher or lower than the true value of the house. 

The dataset includes about 80 different features for each house, such as its area, condition of the property, whether it has a backyard or pool.

#### 2. Purpose of the Project

The main objectives of this project are:

- Using **Classification** build a model to **predict whether a house is expensive.**

- Using **Regression** build a model to **predict the selling price of a house.**

#### 3. Steps of the Project

*   Reading data & first glance
*   Data Pre-processing & Cleaning
*   Splitting Data into Training and Test Set
*   Creating Pipeline
*   Applying algorithms
*   Comparing the accuracy scores
*   Using the Model on the Test Data

#### 4. Technical Skills

- Python (Scikit-Learn, Pandas)

- Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms (Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, GaussianNB, Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, Logarithmic Transformation, KNN)
