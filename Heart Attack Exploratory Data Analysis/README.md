### Project Objectives & Overview
#### 1. Overview

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics. It's one of the best practices used in Data Science today.

With the help of EDA, we can easily understand the structure and content of the data, find patterns, identify outliers, and explore the relationship between variables using non-graphical and graphical techniques.


**The Business Problem:** Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally. According to the WHO, an estimated 17.9 million people died from heart disease each year. 85% of these deaths are caused by heart attack and stroke.




#### 2. Purpose of the Project

In this project, I will use the Heart Attack Dataset to perform Exploratory Data Analysis. The data set is publicly available on Kaggle.
It provides the patients’ information with 14 attributes. Each attribute is a potential risk factor.


#### 3. Technical Skills

- Python (Plotly, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)

#### 4. Conclusions

- The dataset contains 303 Rows and 14 Columns.
- We don’t have any missing values in the dataset.

- The distribution of the target column is balanced. 45% of the dataset are lower-risk patients, and 54% percent of the dataset are higher-risk patients.
- As we can see in the third pilot, male patients have higher risk of having heart attack.

- Most of the patients have age (50-60). In which maximum number of Patients have age 58.

- Most of the patients have type of **Typical Angina**.
- Patients with **Non-anginal pain** have a higher risk of heart attack

**Cholesterol**

- With increasing age, the cholesterol level in the body also increases.

- If there is a high cholesterol level in the body, there is also a high risk of heart attack.

**Blood Pressure**

- There is high chance of Increase in Blood Pressure in the body with increase in Age.

**Heart Rate**

- Person having higher heart rate are more probable to suffer from Heart Attack.
