## Spotify Clustering Songs | Unsupervised Machine Learning
### Project Objectives & Overview
#### 1. Overview

Moosic is a little start-up that creates curated playlists in old and new trends.

Users can subscribe to their website and listen to these playlists through their preferred Music App (Spotify, Apple Music, Youtube Music). They would like that their playlists have a specific "mood" or "style." 
 
#### 2. Purpose of the Project
The purpose of this project is to cluster similar songs using K-means clustering algorithm and Spotipy API, thus automatically creating Spotify playlists.

A couple of assessments will have to be made:

- Are Spotify’s audio features able to categorize music with similar songs?
- Is K-Means a good method to create playlists? 

#### 3. Technical Skills

- Python (Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Matplotlib), Requests (API) 

- Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithms (K-Means Clustering)
  

#### 4. Conclusions

- Spotify's audio features manages to get logical playlists

- K-Means method create playlist based on certain audio features, so it may not always produce pleasant sets of songs

- It may be useful to use other features such as genre labelling to improve clustering
