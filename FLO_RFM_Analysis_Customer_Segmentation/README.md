## FLO | Customer Segmentation with RFM Analysis

RFM analysis is a technique used for customer segmentation based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary metrics.

It divides customers into segments based on their purchasing habits, enabling the development of tailored strategies.

- Recency = Analysis date - Customer's last purchase date
- Frequency = Total number of customer purchases (total transactions or invoices)
- Monetary = Total amount spent by the customer
