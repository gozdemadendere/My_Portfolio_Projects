### A/B Testing - Comparison of Bidding Methods

A/B testing is a technique used to determine which version of a product, method, or service performs better by comparing two versions.

It is commonly used to improve website design, app design, advertising, pricing, and other aspects of user experience.

The primary objective of comparing two groups is to test whether any differences observed are due to chance.

### 1. BUSINESS PROBLEM / PROJECT OBJECTIVE 

Facebook recently introduced a new bidding type called "average bidding" as an alternative to the existing "maximum bidding" bidding type.

One of our clients decided to test this new feature and wants to conduct an A/B test to determine whether average bidding brings more conversions than maximum bidding.

The A/B test has been ongoing for 1 month, and now they expect us to analyze the results of this A/B test.

The ultimate success metric for the company is "purchase." Therefore, the focus for statistical tests should be on the Purchase metric.

1. Business Problem
2. Data Understanding & Preparation
3. A/B Testing (Independent Two-Sample T-Test)

______________________________

### 3. PROJECT RESULTS

Based on the hypothesis test, we determined that there is no statistically significant difference between the purchase averages of the Control group (Maximum Bidding) and the Test group (Average Bidding).

Therefore, no significant performance difference was observed between these two bidding strategies.
According to this test result, there is no reason for the customer to prefer one bidding method over the other.

#### Recommendations:
- A/B Testing was conducted with only 80 observations. This sample size can be increased, and testing can continue on different groups.
- A more comprehensive analysis can be conducted by considering other factors:
- The Earning metric can also be examined to evaluate the impact of different bidding strategies on revenue.
- Impression (ad views): An additional analysis on this metric can evaluate the effect of the two bidding strategies on advertising performance.
